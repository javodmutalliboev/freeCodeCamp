        Norman Ernest Borlaug (/ˈbɔːrlɔːɡ/; March 25, 1914 – September 12,
        2009)[2] was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that
        contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed
        the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work,
        including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and
        the Congressional Gold Medal, one of only seven people to have received
        all three awards.[3]
